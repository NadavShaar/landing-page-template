I am still working on a sketch for the desktop layout,
Please don't change any html & css files until it will be ready.
My leftovers are:
- contact section (1/2 day)
- refactoring (2 days)

Only when i'm done with the refactoring (that should be ease the process of making the layout responsive,
we will start to add assignment for everyone.

In the mean while what can be done is:
- writing content (by design - try to minimize design changes since it will add more time for development).
